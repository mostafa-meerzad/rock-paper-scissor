## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library for React JS

### What I learned

How complex apps are structured, Using Framer-motion, Checking for mediaQueries  if they match in JavaScript


### Continued development

I struggled a lot making options-spinner animating it and placing all element together while they are acting independently.

### Useful resources

- [Change animations based on mediaQuery in framer-motion ](https://samuelkraft.com/blog/responsive-animation-framer-motion) - This helped me to add different animations based on DOM matching different mediaQueries.
